    the `with` statement.

    The implementation for this class is heavily borrowed from the pymc3
    library and adapted with the design goals of TensorTrade in mind.

    Arguments:
        shared: A context that is shared between all components that are made under the overarching `TradingContext`.
        exchanges: A context that is specific to components with a registered name of `exchanges`.
        actions: A context that is specific to components with a registered name of `actions`.
        rewards: A context that is specific to components with a registered name of `rewards`.
        features: A context that is specific to components with a registered name of `features`.

    Warnings:
        If there is a conflict in the contexts of different components because
        they were initialized under different contexts, can have undesirable effects.
        Therefore, a warning should be made to the user indicating that using
        components together that have conflicting contexts can lead to unwanted
        behavior.
