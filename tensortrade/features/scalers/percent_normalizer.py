class PercentChangeNormalizer(FeatureTransformer):
    """
    A transformer for normalizing values within a feature pipeline by the percent change of the previous value.
    This would be used in cases where you want to generalize away from values where specific values have a meaning.
    For example, if you are thinking about this on the close price, it has an advantage and a disadvantage:
        - advantage: the price jump from 100 to 101 will be normalized the same as the price jump from 101 to 102.1
        - disadvantage: the system will have a harder time with action dependent on specific values, like the price
                        is constantly attracted to 100.
