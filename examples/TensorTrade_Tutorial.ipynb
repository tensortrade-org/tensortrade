    "Winning high stakes poker tournaments, beating world-class StarCraft players, and autonomously driving Tesla's futuristic sports cars. What do they all have in common? Each of these extremely complex tasks were long thought to be impossible by machines, until only recently being made possible through the massive advancements in deep reinforcement learning. \n",

    "Reinforcement learning is beginning to take over the world.\n",

    "A little over two months ago, I decided I wanted to take part in the revolution, so I set out on a journey to create a profitable Bitcoin trading strategy using state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms. While I made quite a bit of progress on that front, I realized that the tooling for this sort of project can be quite daunting to wrap your head around, and as such, it is very easy to get lost in the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In between optimizing my previous project for distributed high-performance computing (HPC) systems; getting lost in endless pipelines of data and feature optimizations; and running my head in circles around efficient model set-up, tuning, training, and evaluation; I realized that there had to be a better way of doing things. After countless hours of researching existing projects, spending endless nights watching PyData conference talks, and having many back-and-forth conversations with the hundreds of members of the  RL trading Discord community, I realized there weren't any existing solutions that were all that good.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were many bits and pieces of great reinforcement learning trading systems spread across the inter-webs, but nothing solid and complete. For this reason, I've decided to create an open source Python framework for getting any trading strategy from idea to production, efficiently, using deep reinforcement learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Enter TensorTrade. The idea was to create a highly modular framework for building efficient reinforcement learning trading strategies in a composable, maintainable way. Sounds like a mouthful of buzz-words if you ask me, so let's get into the meat."

    "TensorTrade is an open source Python framework for training, evaluating, and deploying robust trading strategies using deep reinforcement learning. The framework focuses on being highly composable and extensible, to allow the system to scale from simple trading strategies on a single CPU, to complex investment strategies run on a distribution of HPC machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, the framework uses many of the APIs from existing machine learning libraries to maintain high quality data pipelines and learning models. One of the main goals of TensorTrade is to enable fast experimentation with algorithmic trading strategies, by leveraging the existing tools and pipelines provided by `numpy`, `pandas`, `gym`, `keras`, and `tensorflow`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to simplify the process of testing and deploying robust trading agents using deep reinforcement learning, to allow you and I to focus on creating profitable strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## RL Primer\n",
    "\n",
    "In case your reinforcement learning chops are a bit rusty, let's quickly go over the basic concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every reinforcement learning problem starts out with an environment and one or more agents that can interact with the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Primer](img/primer.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "_This technique is based off Markov Decision Processes (MDP) dating back to the 1950s._\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent will first observe the environment, then build a model of the current state and the expected value of actions within that environment. Based on that model, the agent will then take the action it has deemed as having the highest expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the effects of the chosen action within the environment, the agent will be rewarded by an amount corresponding to the actual value of that action. The reinforcement learning agent can then, through the process of trial and error (i.e. learning through reinforcement), improve its underlying model and learn to take more rewarding actions over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you still need a bit of refreshment on the subject, there is a link to an article titled _Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning_ in the references for this article, which goes much more in-depth into the details. Let's move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "The following tutorial should provide enough examples to get you started with creating simple trading strategies using TensorTrade, although you will quickly see the framework is capable of handling much more complex configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorTrade requires Python 3.5 or later, so make sure you're using a valid version before pip installing the framework. "

If a pipeline has been added to a particular exchange, then observations will be passed through the `FeaturePipeline` before being output to the environment.

    "# Final Thoughts\n",

    "TensorTrade is a powerful framework capable of building highly modular, high performance trading systems. It is fairly simple and easy to experiment with new trading and investment strategies, while allowing you to leverage components from one strategy in another. But don't take my word for it, create a strategy of your own and start teaching your robots to take over the world!\n",
    "\n",
    "While this tutorial should be enough to get you started, there is still quite a lot more to learn if you want to create a profitable trading strategy. I encourage you to head over to the [Github](https://github.com/notadamking/tensortrade) and dive into the codebase, or take a look at our documentation at [tensortrade.org](https://tensortrade.org). There is also quite an active [Discord community](https://discord.gg/ZZ7BGWh) with nearly 1000 total members, so if you have questions, feedback, or feature requests, feel free to drop them there!\n",
    "\n",
    "![Commits](img/commits.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I've gotten the project to a highly usable state. Though, my time is limited, and I believe there are many of you out there who could make valuable contributions to the open source codebase. So if you are a developer or data scientist with an interest in building state-of-the-art trading systems, I'd love to see you open a pull request, even if its just a simple test case!\n",
    "\n",
    "Others have asked how they can contribute to the project without writing code. There are currently three ways that you can do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write code or documentation for the TensorTrade framework. Many issues on the Github are funded through Gitcoin smart contracts, so you can actually get paid to contribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Fund this project with either [Bitcoin](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/1Lc47bhYvdyKGk1qN8oBHdYQTkbFLL3PFw) or [Ethereum](https://www.blockchain.com/eth/address/0x9907A0cF64Ec9Fbf6Ed8FD4971090DE88222a9aC). These donations are used to fund our Gitcoin smart contracts, which allows anyone who contributes quality code and documentation to get paid for their contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sponsor me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/notadamking). Your support means a lot to me, and allows me to continue spending my time working on the framework and writing articles like this. All patrons have gotten early access to this article and codebase, and will continue to get early access to any articles I write in the future as a thank you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks for reading! As always, all of the code for this tutorial can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/notadamking/tensortrade).
