TensorTrade is an open source Python framework for building, training, evaluating, and deploying robust trading algorithms using reinforcement learning. This framework aims to extend the existing ML pipelines created by `numpy`, `pandas`, `gym`, `keras`, and `tensorflow` in a simple, intuitive way.

Allow state-of-the-art learning agents to improve your trading strategies and take you from idea to production, in a repeatable, maintable way.

_The goal of this framework is to enable fast experimentation, while maintaining production-quality data pipelines._

Read [the documentation](https://tensortrade.org) or walk through [the tutorial](https://medium.com/@notadamking/trade-smarter-w-reinforcement-learning-a5e91163f315).

## Guiding principles

_Inspired by [Keras' guiding principles](https://github.com/keras-team/keras)_

- **User friendliness.** TensorTrade is an API designed for human beings, not machines. It puts user experience front and center. TensorTrade follows best practices for reducing cognitive load: it offers consistent & simple APIs, it minimizes the number of user actions required for common use cases, and it provides clear and actionable feedback upon user error.

- **Modularity.** A trading environment is a conglomeration of fully configurable modules that can be plugged together with as few restrictions as possible. In particular, instrument exchanges, feature pipelines, action strategies, reward strategies, trading agents, and performance reports are all standalone modules that you can combine to create new trading environments.

- **Easy extensibility.** New modules are simple to add (as new classes and functions), and existing modules provide ample examples. To be able to easily create new modules allows for total expressiveness, making TensorTrade suitable for advanced research and production use.

## Getting Started

You can get started testing on Google Colab or your local machine, by viewing our [many examples](https://github.com/notadamking/tensortrade/tree/master/examples)

## Installation

TensorTrade requires Python >= 3.5 for all functionality to work as expected.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Installing with Docker

**1.)** Install docker depending on your operating system. Unsure on how to install? Check out https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop or if you're on ubuntu >= 18.04, try 'snap install docker'.

**2.)** run ```make docker-build```

**3.)** run ```make docker-run```

**4.)** from the output. you should see a link in your terminal linking to 127.0.0.1:8888/?token=.... paste this link into your browser

**5.)** navigate to examples/TensorTrade_Tutorial.ipynb and get familliar with the framework!
```
