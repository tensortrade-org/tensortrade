# Exchange

Exchanges determine the universe of tradable instruments within a trading environment, return observations to the environment on each time step, and execute trades made within the environment. There are two types of exchanges: live and simulated.

Live exchanges are implementations of `Exchange` backed by live pricing data and a live trade execution engine. For example, `CCXTExchange` is a live exchange, which is capable of returning pricing data and executing trades on hundreds of live cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance and Coinbase.

```python
import ccxt
from tensortrade.exchanges.live import CCXTExchange

coinbase = ccxt.coinbasepro()
exchange = CCXTExchange(exchange=coinbase, base_instrument='USD')
```

_There are also exchanges for stock and ETF trading, such as RobinhoodExchange and InteractiveBrokersExchange, but these are still works in progress._

Simulated exchanges, on the other hand, are implementations of `Exchange` backed by simulated pricing data and trade execution.

For example, `FBMExchange` is a simulated exchange, which generates pricing and volume data using fractional brownian motion (FBM). Since its price is simulated, the trades it executes must be simulated as well. The exchange uses a simple slippage model to simulate price and volume slippage on trades, though like almost everything in TensorTrade, this slippage model can easily be swapped out for something more complex.

```python
from tensortrade.exchanges.simulated import FBMExchange

exchange = FBMExchange(base_instrument='BTC', timeframe='1h')
```

Though the `FBMExchange` generates fake price and volume data using a stochastic model, it is simply an implementation of `SimulatedExchange`. Under the hood, `SimulatedExchange` only requires a `data_frame` of price history to generate its simulations. This `data_frame` can either be provided by a coded implementation such as `FBMExchange`, or at runtime.

```python
import pandas as pd
from tensortrade.exchanges.simulated import SimulatedExchange

df = pd.read_csv('./data/btc_ohclv_1h.csv')
exchange = SimulatedExchange(data_frame=df, base_instrument='USD')
```

## Purpose of `Exchange`?

Inside of the [README](../README.md), you'll have seen the reason why we have the higher level abstract. It reiterate, `Exchange` is the highest level abstract for all other exchanges. It has functions used through all others.

## Class Parameters

- `base_instrument`
  - The exchange symbol of the instrument to store/measure value in.
- `dtype`
  - A type or str corresponding to the dtype of the `observation_space`.
- `feature_pipeline`
  - A pipeline of feature transformations for transforming observations.

## Properties and Setters

- `base_instrument`
  - The exchange symbol of the instrument to store/measure value in.
- `dtype`
  - A type or str corresponding to the dtype of the `observation_space`.
- `feature_pipeline`
  - A pipeline of feature transformations for transforming observations.
- `base_precision`
  - The floating point precision of the base instrument.
- `instrument_precision`
  - The floating point precision of the instrument to be traded.
- `initial_balance`
  - The initial balance of the base symbol on the exchange.
- `balance`
  - The current balance of the base symbol on the exchange.
- `portfolio`
  - The current balance of each symbol on the exchange (non-positive balances excluded).
- `trades`
  - A list of trades made on the exchange since the last reset.
- `performance`
  - The performance of the active account on the exchange since the last reset.
- `generated_space`
  - The initial shape of the observations generated by the exchange, before feature transformations.
- `generated_columns`
  - The list of column names of the observation data frame generated by the exchange, before feature transformations.
- `observation_space`
  - The final shape of the observations generated by the exchange, after feature transformations.
- `net_worth`
  - Calculate the net worth of the active account on the exchange.
- `profit_loss_percent`
  - Calculate the percentage change in net worth since the last reset.
- `has_next_observation`
  - If `False`, the exchange's data source has run out of observations.
  - Resetting the exchange may be necessary to continue generating observations.

## Functions

Below are the functions that the `Exchange` uses to effectively operate.

### Private

- `_create_observation_generator`

### Public

- `has_next_observation`
  - Return the reward corresponding to the selected risk-adjusted return metric.
- `next_observation`
  - Generate the next observation from the exchange.
- `instrument_balance`
  - The current balance of the specified symbol on the exchange, denoted in the base instrument.
- `current_price`
  - The current price of an instrument on the exchange, denoted in the base instrument.
- `execute_trade`
  - Execute a trade on the exchange, accounting for slippage.
- `reset`
  - Reset the feature pipeline, initial balance, trades, performance, and any other temporary stateful data.
