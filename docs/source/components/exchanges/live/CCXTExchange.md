  - A type or str corresponding to the dtype of the `observation_space`.
- `feature_pipeline`
  - A pipeline of feature transformations for transforming observations.

## Properties and Setters

  - The exchange symbol of the instrument to store/measure value in.
- `dtype`
  - A type or str corresponding to the dtype of the `observation_space`.
- `feature_pipeline`
  - A pipeline of feature transformations for transforming observations.
- `base_precision`
  - The floating point precision of the base instrument.
- `instrument_precision`
  - The floating point precision of the instrument to be traded.
- `initial_balance`
  - The initial balance of the base symbol on the exchange.
- `balance`
  - The current balance of the base symbol on the exchange.
- `portfolio`
  - The current balance of each symbol on the exchange (non-positive balances excluded).
- `trades`
  - A list of trades made on the exchange since the last reset.
- `performance`
  - The performance of the active account on the exchange since the last reset.
- `generated_space`
  - The initial shape of the observations generated by the exchange, before feature transformations.
- `observation_columns`
  - The list of column names of the observation data frame generated by the exchange, before feature transformations.
- `observation_space`
  - The final shape of the observations generated by the exchange, after feature transformations.
- `net_worth`
  - Calculate the net worth of the active account on the exchange.
- `profit_loss_percent`
  - Calculate the percentage change in net worth since the last reset.
- `has_next_observation`
  - If `False`, the exchange's data source has run out of observations.
  - Resetting the exchange may be necessary to continue generating observations.

## Functions

Below are the functions that the `Exchange` uses to effectively operate.

### Private

- `_create_observation_generator`

### Public

- `has_next_observation`
  - Return the reward corresponding to the selected risk-adjusted return metric.
- `next_observation`
  - Generate the next observation from the exchange.
- `instrument_balance`
  - The current balance of the specified symbol on the exchange, denoted in the base instrument.
- `current_price`
  - The current price of an instrument on the exchange, denoted in the base instrument.
- `execute_trade`
  - Execute a trade on the exchange, accounting for slippage.
- `reset`
  - Reset the feature pipeline, initial balance, trades, performance, and any other temporary stateful data.

## Use Cases

**Use Case #1: Initiating CCXTExchnage**

```python
import ccxt
from tensortrade.exchanges.live import CCXTExchange

coinbase = ccxt.coinbasepro()
exchange = CCXTExchange(exchange=coinbase, base_instrument='USD')
```
